### Hello! I'm Gabriella `(she/hers)`, and welcome to my github!

I'm that junior software developer and devops engineer who spends a lot of time caring about how her online profiles look!

Currently studying Computer Science at MSU Denver.

I'm a Author, Musician, and GameDev

I do not currently use GitHub as my main code maintenance place. Please check out my own (gitea instance)[https://git.contrastellar.com]!
